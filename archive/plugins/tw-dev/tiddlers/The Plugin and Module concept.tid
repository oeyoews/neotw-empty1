title: The Plugin and Module concept
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Beside the boot kernel, TW is completely build from modules.
After a short introduction on modules and plug-ins in the context of TW and explaining how they are organized and managed,
the following sections will show what type of modules a developer can build and how they hook into the TW architecture.
The last section shows the procedure of building an plug-in.
This can be used as a tutorial for building your own plug-ins and will show how an advanced user can create solutions for his own use cases only by using the tiddler model and the WikiText markup language.
